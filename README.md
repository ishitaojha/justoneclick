Yeah this website was more of a personal project to build a site to showcase some pictures clicked by my friend.

## LIBRARY

All the Animations and Scroll Triggers were made using the [GSAP-GreenSock](https://greensock.com/gsap/)

The site needs a lot of work and I'll keep updating it.

It's also live [here](https://justoneclick.netlify.app/).

## The major things that I need to work on are
1. Make styling for CSS and Update Js according
2. Optimize size and scaling of images.
3. Add a full Gallery 
4. Add a contact form
